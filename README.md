# weatherapi

This is a simple weather app. 
This returns up to 2 cities alongside eachother.

Any new searches will replace the oldest search, and incorrect searches yield an error.

### Why
This is just a small project that I decided I wanted to do as a way to test myself, and also to learn some new skills, such as how to properly use an API key & how to create a fetch request using both the fetch() method and async-await.

### Notes
I built most of this myself, however, I initially used the JS from the app that I was using to understand how this worked. But I have been able to understand what the JS used was doing, and also made a new file which changed the fetch method to an Async-Await method that works exactly the same.
