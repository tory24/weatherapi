# weatherapi
This is a simple weather app, that will return the weather in the city entered. 

This returns up to 4 cities alongside eachother.

### Why?
Again just to test myself, and also to learn how to pull data from an API key.

### Notes
I built most of this myself, however I have used the app I was trying to learn from's JS. I have commented on it myself.

I am planning on altering it to work with my intended vision at a later date.
